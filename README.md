# Song Meaning AI Website

This repo contains my undergoing project for a website that uses AI to describe song lyric meanings. Website is deployed on Vercel.

This project uses Next 13 and MUI v5 components. It uses genius API for song lyrics and will use chat GPT for AI interpretation.

## How to run locally
>add env file with RapidAPI key for genius

>npm install

>cd src

>npm run dev



>use JSON provided as example data from API calls in the getSongList and getSongLyrics functions.

API calls cost money so the project is currently using sample JSON data. If you want to add your own key for the GENIUS api you can get a key here: https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/genius-song-lyrics1/
