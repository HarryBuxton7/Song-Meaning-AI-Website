# Song Meaning AI Website

Website Link: https://song-meaning-ai-website-uilq.vercel.app/

This repo contains my undergoing project for a website that uses AI to describe song lyric meanings. Website is deployed on Vercel.

This project uses Next 13 and MUI v5 components. It uses genius API for song lyrics and uses chat GPT for AI interpretation.

See the development branch for most recent updates.

## How to run locally
>add env file with RapidAPI key for genius

>npm install

>cd src

>npm run dev



>use JSON provided as example data from API calls in the getSongList and getSongLyrics functions.

API calls cost money so the project is currently using sample JSON data. If you want to add your own key for the GENIUS api you can get a key here: https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/genius-song-lyrics1/
